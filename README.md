# Isle Royale Wolf–Moose Predator–Prey Dynamics  
A Mathematical & Machine Learning Analysis of Long-Term Population Behavior of the woolf and Moose in the Isle Royal Island.

# Overview
This project analyzes the predator–prey dynamics on Isle Royale, focusing on the long-term interactions between the wolf (predator) and moose (prey) populations.  
Isle Royale, a remote island in Lake Superior (USA), provides one of the world’s most famous long-term ecological datasets, making it ideal for studying biological population dynamics.

The project combines:
- Mathematical modelling (Lotka–Volterra & modified ODE models)  
- Machine learning approaches for prediction and trend analysis  
- Data visualization to understand multi-decade ecosystem behavior  

# Objectives
- Model the growth and decline of wolf and moose populations.
- Study stability, equilibrium points, and long-term behavior.
- Fit predator–prey ODE models to real data.
- Use machine learning methods (regression / forecasting) to predict population trends.
- Compare classical modelling vs machine learning predictions.

# Background
Isle Royale’s ecosystem is primarily driven by:
- Moose → herbivores that depend on vegetation  
- Wolves → predators that regulate moose population  

Their interaction follows predator–prey dynamics influenced by:
- Food availability  
- Weather & climate  
- Disease (e.g., canine distemper)  
- Temperature
- Snow Depth 

This makes the data highly interesting for modelling and forecasting.
